Just a stupid idea to stream social media on the commandline. The idea was to make it look like interesting shit is happening on your screen all the time, while getting your news and crap.

Ideally would support Twitter, Facebook, Google Reader, and Google Plus.
If I feel frisky I could integrate XMPP to scan for incoming Facebook and Gchat notifications.
Maybe email support, just showing subject and author.

It's read-only for now, I'm not interested in making another client, just an aggregator.

Configurable Growl support on OSX, and whatever equivilent on Gnome/KDE and Windows 7.

Uhhh, thats all.
